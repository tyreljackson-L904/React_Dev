## Description

This is a React application that uses the public Pokemon API to generate pokemon and display them to the user. I have integrated pagination and API calls to get a limited number of Pokemon per request.

The user can also search for Pokemon that will filter as the user types.

This application was the first application i built to integrate and get practice with integrating API's to fetch user requested data.
