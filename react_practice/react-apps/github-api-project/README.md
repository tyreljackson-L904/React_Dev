This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

I wanted to build a way for people to search for github user profiles and get their basic information. 
Enter a users name and get their profile photo, basic stats on how many followers they have, how many people
they are following and how many repos they have. 
You can then use the side navigation bar to view specific information for those three stats.

## Technologies/Languages/Tools
- React (functional components)
- React Router v6
- TypeScript
- Firebase & oAuth for user authentication
- Axios for API calls
- Styled Components
- Custom CSS styling
- VSCode
- Git

Building this application taught me alot about persisting data between screens, using React Router API's to grab that data,
how to effectively work with public API's to get user data and how to effectively display that data in a meaningful way.

One of the most useful things I learned was how to utilize React Router useParams to grab data, navigate to pages and
persist data between renders.
